# CAPS (Code Academy Parcel Service)

**CAPS Phase 1:** Begin the build of an application for a company called **CAPS** - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, we'll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. **CAPS** will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

Tactically, this will be an event driven application that "distributes" the responsibility for logging to separate modules, using only events to trigger logging based on activity.

## Before you begin

Refer to _Getting Started_ in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Create a UML diagram of the **CAPS** system on a whiteboard before you start.

> Create a new repository for this project, called 'caps' and work in a branch called 'events'.

## Business Requirements

Refer to the [CAPS System Overview](../../apps-and-libraries/caps/README.md) for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

## Phase 1 Requirements

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the CAPS system, written in Node.js. In this first phase, our goal is to setup a system of events and handlers, with the intent being to change out the eventing system as we go, but keeping the handlers themselves largely the same. The task of "delivering a package" doesn't change (the handler), even if the mechanism for triggering that task (the event) does.

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

-   As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up.
-   As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered.
-   As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit.
-   As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered.
-   As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered.

And as developers, here are some of the development stories that are relevant to the above.

-   As a developer, I want to use industry standards for managing the state of each package.
-   As a developer, I want to create an event driven system so that I can write code that happens in response to events, in real time.

## Technical Requirements / Notes

Create the CAPS system as follows:

### Global Event Pool (HUB)

1. Implement a Module for a Global Event Pool.

    - Export a single `EventEmitter` from the [Node JS module](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter).
    - Should be imported by any module that needs to notify or be alerted by other modules of an event.

1. Implement a Module for Managing Global Package Events.

    - Listens to **ALL** events in the Event Pool.
    - Logs a timestamp and the payload of every event.

    ```json
    EVENT {
      "event": "pickup",
      "time": "2020-03-06T18:27:17.732Z",
      "payload": {
        "store": "1-206-flowers",
        "orderID": "e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0",
        "customer": "Jamal Braun",
        "address": "Schmittfort, LA"
      }
    }
    ```

### Vendor Client Application

1. Implement a Module for Managing Vendor Events.

    - Your implementation should use a `store name` as a parameter.
    - Every 5 seconds the Vendor Module simulates a `pickup` event for the given `store name` to the Global Event Pool:

        - emits `pickup` to the global event pool.
        - emits a vendor order `payload`:

        ```json
        {
            "store": "<store-name>",
            "orderId": "<unique-order-id>",
            "customer": "<customer-name>",
            "address": "<city-state>"
        }
        ```

        > HINT: Have some fun by using the [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) library to make up phony information.

    - Listens for a `delivered` event and responds by logging a message to the console:

    ```javascript
     Thank you, <customer-name>
    ```

### Driver Client Application

1. Implement a Module for Managing Driver Events.
    - Listens for a `pickup` event from the Global Event Pool and responds with the following:
        - Wait 1 second to simulate travel time:
            - Log a message to the console: `DRIVER: picked up <ORDER_ID>`.
            - Emit an 'in-transit' event to the Global Event Pool with the order payload.
        - Wait 3 seconds to simulate additional delivery time:
            - Log a confirmation message to the console: `DRIVER: delievered <ORDER_ID>`.
            - Emit a 'delivered` event to the Global Event Pool with the order payload.

When running, your console output should look something like this:

```javascript
EVENT { event: 'pickup',
  time: 2020-03-06T18:27:17.732Z,
  payload:
   { store: '1-206-flowers',
     orderID: 'e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0',
     customer: 'Jamal Braun',
     address: 'Schmittfort, LA' } }
DRIVER: picked up e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0
EVENT { event: 'in-transit',
  time: 2020-03-06T18:27:18.738Z,
  payload:
   { store: '1-206-flowers',
     orderID: 'e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0',
     customer: 'Jamal Braun',
     address: 'Schmittfort, LA' } }
DRIVER: delivered up e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0
VENDOR: Thank you for delivering e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0
EVENT { event: 'delivered',
  time: 2020-03-06T18:27:20.736Z,
  payload:
   { store: '1-206-flowers',
     orderID: 'e3669048-7313-427b-b6cc-74010ca1f8f0',
     customer: 'Jamal Braun',
     address: 'Schmittfort, LA' } }
...
```

### Testing

-   Write unit tests for each event handler function (not event triggers themselves).
-   Use spies to help testing your logger methods (assert that console.log was called right).

**Testing Note** - \*The "event system" in Node.js has already been tested. What we want to test here is connectivity -- is your code responding to the right events?"
